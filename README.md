# Flutter Reminder App

The Flutter Reminder App is an Android application designed to automate and streamline various tasks related to scheduling and reminders. The app leverages Flutter framework to provide a seamless user experience and is capable of performing the following functions:

1. **PDF Reminder:** The app allows users to import PDF documents containing exam schedules, class timetables, or other important information. It automatically extracts the relevant data and sets up reminders for upcoming events.

2. **Exam and Class Scheduling:** Users can input their exam dates, class schedules, or any other important events manually. The app will send timely reminders to ensure that users are well-prepared and never miss any important deadlines or classes.

3. **Location-Based Actions:** The app utilizes the location of the user's device to trigger specific actions. For example, when the user enters a specific location, such as a classroom or exam hall, the app can automatically switch the phone to silent mode to avoid disruptions.

## Features

### 1. PDF Reminder

The PDF Reminder feature enables users to import PDF documents containing relevant information about exams, classes, or any other important events. The app uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract the necessary data from the PDFs, such as dates, times, and event descriptions. The extracted information is then used to set up reminders for the events mentioned in the PDF.

### 2. Exam and Class Scheduling

This feature allows users to manually input their exam dates, class schedules, or any other important events. Users can specify the date, time, and description of the event. The app will send reminders at the specified time to ensure users are well-prepared and on time for their exams or classes.

### 3. Location-Based Actions

The app utilizes the device's location to perform certain actions based on predefined rules. For example, when the user enters a specific location, such as a classroom or exam hall, the app can automatically switch the phone to silent mode to prevent any disruptions during the event. Users can customize the locations and corresponding actions according to their preferences.
